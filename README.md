# Job Search Website

This project is a Java-based backend web application utilizing MongoDB Atlas and Spring Boot. For the frontend, I have employed React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Overview
The website facilitates both job creation and job application processes, providing a platform for employers to post job roles and for job seekers to apply based on their relevant skills.

## Features

1. **Hire People**: Employers can create job listings by specifying roles and requirements. This feature allows organizations to post new job openings for potential candidates.

2. **Get Hired**: Job seekers can browse through available job listings and apply based on their qualifications and skills, simplifying the process of finding relevant employment opportunities.

The platform is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to use for both employers and job seekers.
